# Chessbot3

A simple chess-simulator that supports both local PvP and play against an AI.

The current version has the following features:
* A fully interactable GUI
* A somewhat functioning Chess bot
* Saving and loading games

Planned features include:
* Smarter AI
* Multiplayer over LAN or Internett
* ..And more!

This is very much a work in progress project.
